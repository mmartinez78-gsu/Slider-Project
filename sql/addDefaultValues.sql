    ("The Fifteen Puzzle sparked a national craze in the 1880s, with players competing to solve it in the fewest moves-often without knowing it might be unsolvable!"),
    ("Only half of all possible arrangements of the 15 tiles can actually be solved. The rest? Mathematically impossible!"),
    ("The puzzle was never officially patented during its craze, leading to multiple inventors claiming credit-including a postmaster from New York!"),
    ("Before Sudoku or crosswords took over newspapers, the Fifteen Puzzle was the go-to test of logic and patience."),
    ("The Fifteen Puzzle is the ancestor of all modern sliding tile games, including digital variants seen in countless video games."),
    ("In competitions, solving the puzzle in under 30 seconds is considered world-class. Most people can't manage it under five minutes!"),
    ("During the Gilded Age, the puzzle was so popular that companies printed their logos on them as promotional items."),
    ("Despite being a simple 4x4 grid with 15 tiles, the number of permutations is over 20 trillion!"),
    ("The Fifteen Puzzle was created in the 1870s, with credit often going to Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster from New York who claimed to invent it in 1874. Though Chapman may have invented the puzzle, Sam Loyd, a famous American puzzlemaker, popularized it later-and falsely claimed to be its creator, stirring controversy for decades."),
    ("There are 20,922,789,888,000 possible tile arrangements on a 4x4 Fifteen Puzzle board-but only half of those can ever be solved. The rest are mathematically unreachable due to parity rules."),
    ("Whether a puzzle is solvable depends on the number of tile inversions and the row of the blank tile. This discovery helped formalize the field of permutation group theory."),
    ("By 1880, the Fifteen Puzzle had become an international fad. Puzzle salons and newspaper challenges sprang up in cities like New York, London, and Paris."),
    ("The puzzle has been used in classrooms to teach group theory, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies. It's a tactile introduction to complex math concepts."),
    ("Solving the Fifteen Puzzle efficiently inspired early work in computer science, including pathfinding algorithms like A* (A-star), which is still used in modern AI."),
    ("In its heyday, people were often tricked into trying to solve an unsolvable configuration-especially the infamous challenge to swap just tiles 14 and 15. Spoiler: you can't."),
    ("Originally made from sliding wooden tiles in a tray, the puzzle was one of the first mechanical games to seamlessly transition into digital form-appearing in early software and handheld games.");
